    desk1: `Sometimes we sacrifice ourselves too much and feel uncomfortable answering "no" to someone, as a result we do things with a heavy heart.`,

    desk2: `Especially if we don't have more earning power, that's what makes us uncomfortable saying "no". Everything is measured by income, it seems cruel but that's the fact.`,

    desk3: `So in essence, no matter how much we earn, if we don't feel comfortable, we have to have the courage to say "no", who else will understand us if not ourselves.`,
