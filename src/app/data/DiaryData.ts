    desk1: `Sometimes we sacrifice ourselves too often and feel uncomfortable saying “no” to others. As a result, we prefer to force ourselves to say "yes", which ultimately makes us do something with a heavy heart.`,

    desk2: `I experienced firsthand how being a people pleaser, makes me continually strive to please others. However, in the end, I learned that sacrificing myself does not bring true happiness. Through this personal journey, I realized the importance of valuing myself, and prioritizing personal happiness as a foundation for better helping others.`,

    desk3: `There is no need to always please others to gain their acceptance. Sincerity and one's own happiness are more important than sacrificing oneself for the sake of others. Be yourself, because only then can you find true happiness.`,
